# Mongolic Timeline

A brief timeline condensing the complicated academic understanding of the timing and relationships betwreen Middle Mongol, Written Mongol, Proto-Mongolic and modern Mongolic languages including Mongolian proper.

## Motivation

While studying up on the language of the early days of the Mongol Empire, I ran into a variety of sources that layered many linguistic concepts atop each other. These concepts were based on discrepancies in features between linguistic stages, as is normal, but also between pieces of evidence from the same stage.

For those early days, there are three basic terms: Middle Mongol, Written Mongol and Proto-Mongolic. _(Give a description and example of PM vs MM vs WM.)_

This timeline aims to give an overview of Mongolian linguistic history, with a focus on the position of the language during the rise of the empire.
